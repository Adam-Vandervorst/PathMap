# A Zipper is a Cursor in a Map

Conceptually a [Zipper] refers to a location within a map, called its `focus`.  The zipper's focus may be accessed by calling [Zipper::path].  When an operation is applied through a zipper, it acts on the focus.

A zipper's focus may be moved to a longer path (called `descending`) or to a shorter path (called `ascending`) subject to limits covered in greater detail later in this chapter.
