# A Zipper is a Cursor in a Map

Conceptually a [Zipper] refers to a location within a map, called its `focus`.  The zipper's focus may be accessed by calling [Zipper::path].  When an operation is applied through a zipper, it acts on the focus.

A zipper's focus may be moved to a longer path (called `descending`) or to a shorter path (called `ascending`) subject to limits covered in greater detail later in this chapter.

# Read-only Zippers vs WriteZippers

GOAT, To write.


GOAT, make a diagram / table with all the zipper-like API objects.  Show where each one fits based on criteria of: *Writeable, *Movable, *Cost-to-Create, *'static Lifetime, etc.

PathMap: 'static lifetime, Writeable, NOT Movable, medium-cost to create
TrieRef: borrowed lifetime, NOT Writeable, NOT Movable, ultra low cost to create
ReadZipperOwned: 'static lifetime, NOT Writeable, Movable, high cost to create
ReadZipper: borrowed lifetime, NOT Writeable, Movable, low cost to create
WriteZipperOwned: 'static lifetime, Writeable, Movable, high cost to create
WriteZipper: borrowed lifetime, Writeable, Movable, low cost to create
